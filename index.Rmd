### 1. Electrification as a shock to labour demand: worker skills and internal migration in Sweden

### 2. Labour automation and augmentation as a result of technological change

# Electricity #1

### Motivation for looking at micro-level data on workers

There is work on Sweden already looking at [electricity and technology-skill complementary]() by Prado and Theorotidis. This focusses on manufacturing firms.

There is also work examining [labour relations and workers' response to electrification]() in Sweden by Molinder, Karlsson and Enflo. This looks at the first major expansion of the electricity grid.

# Electricity #2

### How has electrification augmented labour demand and how has it automated away labour?

There is super interesting work on how industrialization (specifically iron mining) in Sweden impacted the workers who were displaced from artisanal production as mines became fewer in number and larger in size. [Poignant, van Maarseveen and Bengtsson]() find that workers who were displaced moved away to find employment in new occupations, and see lower wages to the magnitude of 10 percent as a result.

In Electricity #1 I hope to show how labour moved to areas with electricity to seek new kinds of employment. In paper #2 I want to **quantify the new kinds of employment** and **measure the rate at which new jobs are created and old ones destroyed**.

---
# Electricity #2

### What's the template?

All the big boys write about this stuff:

1. [Goldin and Katz (2008)]() explain the canonical model for labour augmenting technology

1. [Acemoglu and Autor (2011)]() revise the model to account for polarization in the US labour market and introduce automation to the model

1. [Autor, Salomons, Seegmiller (2022)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/21810) attempt to measure the kinds of technologies that replace labour and the kinds that boost labour productivity. They use occupational titles, occupation descriptions and census data. **This is the template**.

# Electricity #2

### Augmentation vs Automation of work

<blockquote>

We hypothesize that new tasks emerge in occupations where new innovations complement their outputs (‘augmentation’) or market size expands, while conversely, employment contracts in occupations where innovations substitute for labour inputs (‘automation’) or market size contracts.

.pull-left[

I need to have information on:

1. Labour outputs, e.g. occupational titles

1. Labour inputs, e.g. a description of what the worker does

1. Types of new technology being brought to market, e.g. patents

# Electricity #2
### Methodology 

Use natural language processing to compare the words used in the occupational titles and occupational descriptions to the corpus of patent data.

More similar to titles -> complement their outputs (‘augmentation’)
More similar to tasks -> substitute for labour inputs (‘automation’)

* Uncommon occupations are listed in free text below table

* As these occupations become more popular they move onto the grid

* Specifies vacancies by rank in some occupations

### How many jobs can you take the tube to in London?

The Roy model (1951) says as a worker you should do the thing that you have the highest comparative advantage in.

If you live on an fishing island, the cost of travel prevents you from becoming a banker. If you live in London, you can take the tube.

# Transportation technology

### Stockholm was reimainged in the second half of the 20th century

The city adopted modernist architectural ideals:

* Separating work from home

* Destroying housing in the city centre

* Building highways and expanding the metro to enable commuting

Interesting economic questions about when the transport infrastructure was built:

* Did it enable people to commute to more jobs - different jobs - better jobs?

---

# Transportation technology

### How to answer these questions with individual level data?

.pull-left[

The Stockholm city archive have mantalslängder that record:

* Name
* Occupational title 
* Home address
* Workplace name

# Transportation technology
### Methods to assess job mobility / individual mobility

1. Assign individuals to geocoded home locations based on address

1. Geocode workplaces perhaps using workplace calendar

1. Follow how occupational title and distance between work and home changed over time!

1. If no matching, just track distance between work and home over time by occupation / social class.

Can answer questions like:

* Who was made worse off by dividing the city?

* Who had better access to city amenities as a response to infrastructure?

# Urban design

A mystery for the moment.

# Methods

A whole lot of the previous section depends on the ability to digitize and make machine readable old documents.

Other folks may be interested in doing this too - 

AWS Textract and AWS Comprehend are super useful tools for this purpose:

Have a look at [this paper by Amujala, Vossmeyer and Das](https://www.angelavossmeyer.com/uploads/5/6/6/2/56627489/northwestern_exeh_amujalavossmeyerdas_paper.pdf) which shows how they used these tools to digitize data from handwritten card index records.

I tried to make Melissa Dell's tool called [Layout Parser](https://layout-parser.github.io/) work last year but was unsuccessful. I think perhaps if I had done a computer science undergrad it might work well.

I think it's better to just pay AWS to make it work - it's also a skill that is super useful in the workforce.

# Electricity #2

### Motivation for looking at micro-level data on workers

There is work on Sweden already looking at [electricity and technology-skill complementary]() by Prado and Theorotidis. This focusses on manufacturing firms.

There is also work examining [labour relations and workers' response to electrification]() in Sweden by Molinder, Karlsson and Enflo. This looks at the first major expansion of the electricity grid.

# Electricity #3

### How has electrification augmented labour demand and how has it automated away labour?

In Electricity #2 I hope to show how labour moved to areas with electricity to seek new kinds of employment. In paper #2 I want to **quantify the new kinds of employment** and **measure the rate at which new jobs are created and old ones destroyed**.

---
# Electricity #3

### What's the template?

All the big boys write about this stuff:

1. [Goldin and Katz (2008)]() explain the canonical model for labour augmenting technology

1. [Acemoglu and Autor (2011)]() revise the model to account for polarization in the US labour market and introduce automation to the model

1. [Autor, Salomons, Seegmiller (2022)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/21810) attempt to measure the kinds of technologies that replace labour and the kinds that boost labour productivity. They use occupational titles, occupation descriptions and census data. **This is the template**.

# Electricity #3

.pull-left[

### Augmentation vs Automation of work

<blockquote>

We hypothesize that new tasks emerge in occupations where new innovations complement their outputs (‘augmentation’) or market size expands, while conversely, employment contracts in occupations where innovations substitute for labour inputs (‘automation’) or market size contracts.

We want to compare the similarity of:

1. Labour outputs, e.g. occupational titles,

1. Labour inputs, e.g. a description of what the worker does

and

* Types of new technology being brought to market, e.g. patents

# Electricity #3
### Methodology 

Use natural language processing to compare the words used in the occupational titles and occupational descriptions to the corpus of patent data.

More similar to titles -> complement their outputs (‘augmentation’)
More similar to tasks -> substitute for labour inputs (‘automation’)

### Stockholm was reimainged in the second half of the 20th century

The city adopted modernist architectural ideals:

* Separating work from home

* Destroying housing in the city centre

* Building highways and expanding the metro to enable commuting

Interesting economic questions about when the transport infrastructure was built:

* Did it enable people to commute to more jobs - different jobs - better jobs?

# Transportation technology
### Methods to assess job mobility / individual mobility

1. Assign individuals to geocoded home locations based on address

1. Geocode workplaces perhaps using workplace calendar

1. Follow how occupational title and distance between work and home changed over time!

1. If no matching, just track distance between work and home over time by occupation / social class.

Can answer questions like:

* Who was made worse off by dividing the city?

* Who had better access to city amenities as a response to infrastructure?

## Two Papers:

### 1. Electrification as a shock to labour demand: worker skills and internal migration in Sweden

### 2. Labour automation and augmentation as a result of technological change

# Electricity #1

### Motivation for looking at micro-level data on workers

There is work on Sweden already looking at [electricity and technology-skill complementary]() by Prado and Theorotidis. This focusses on manufacturing firms.

There is also work examining [labour relations and workers' response to electrification]() in Sweden by Molinder, Karlsson and Enflo. This looks at the first major expansion of the electricity grid.

# Electricity #2

### How has electrification augmented labour demand and how has it automated away labour?

There is super interesting work on how industrialization (specifically iron mining) in Sweden impacted the workers who were displaced from artisanal production as mines became fewer in number and larger in size. [Poignant, van Maarseveen and Bengtsson]() find that workers who were displaced moved away to find employment in new occupations, and see lower wages to the magnitude of 10 percent as a result.

In Electricity #1 I hope to show how labour moved to areas with electricity to seek new kinds of employment. In paper #2 I want to **quantify the new kinds of employment** and **measure the rate at which new jobs are created and old ones destroyed**.

---
# Electricity #2

### What's the template?

All the big boys write about this stuff:

1. [Goldin and Katz (2008)]() explain the canonical model for labour augmenting technology

1. [Acemoglu and Autor (2011)]() revise the model to account for polarization in the US labour market and introduce automation to the model

1. [Autor, Salomons, Seegmiller (2022)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/21810) attempt to measure the kinds of technologies that replace labour and the kinds that boost labour productivity. They use occupational titles, occupation descriptions and census data. **This is the template**.

### Augmentation vs Automation of work

<blockquote>

We hypothesize that new tasks emerge in occupations where new innovations complement their outputs (‘augmentation’) or market size expands, while conversely, employment contracts in occupations where innovations substitute for labour inputs (‘automation’) or market size contracts.

# Electricity #2

### Following methodology of [Autor, Salomons, Seegmiller (2021)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/21810)


.pull-left[

I need to have information on:

1. Labour outputs, e.g. occupational titles

1. Labour inputs, e.g. a description of what the worker does

1. Types of new technology being brought to market, e.g. patents

]

```{r}
autor_needs <- tibble(title = "Medical Technologist",
       tasks = "Performs medical laboratory tests, procedures, analyses to provide data for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease",
       tech = "Theranos blood testing machine that can do these things")

autor_needs %>% kable(col.names = c("Title", "Task", "Tech"))
```


]

---
# Electricity #2
### Methodology 

Use natural language processing to compare the words used in the occupational titles and occupational descriptions to the corpus of patent data.

More similar to titles -> complement their outputs (‘augmentation’)
More similar to tasks -> substitute for labour inputs (‘automation’)

include_graphics(here("images", "autor_methodology.PNG"))

### My data on occupational titles and descriptions over time:

.pull-left[

#### Riksvakanslistan

* State vacancy lists produced weekly between 1915 and 1958

* Records number of vacancies by occupational title and region

* Uncommon occupations are listed in free text below table

* As these occupations become more popular they move onto the grid

* Specifies vacancies by rank in some occupations

Interesting economic questions is when the subway was built - did it enable people to commute to more jobs - different jobs - better jobs. To start we can ask - how did the subway allow people to work at different places.


Mantalslängder has got name, occupational title, home address and work address. So what I need to do is to digitize these - extract the information into a computer readable form

---
# Methods

A whole lot of the previous section depends on the ability to digitize and make machine readable old documents.

Other folks may be interested in doing this too - 

AWS Textract and AWS Comprehend are super useful tools for this purpose:

Have a look at my example here, or at this talk by someone - recorded here - which shows how she used these tools to 

I tried to make Melissa Dell's tool called [Layout Parser](https://layout-parser.github.io/) work last year but was unsuccessful. I think perhaps if I had done a computer science undergrad it might work well.

I think it's better to just pay AWS to make it work - it's also a skill that is super useful in the workforce.
